\section* {Purpose}

This document describes the coding standard for Scheme code.  It is
heavily inspired by the Erlang Programming Rules and
Conventions~\cite{erlang-programming-rules}, as well as \emph{The
  Scheme Programming Language}~\cite{the-scheme-programming-language}.

\section* {Counting Standard}

Count each physical line as one line of code (LOC). Blank lines and
comment-only lines will be included. A blank line should appear
between each top-level function definition. Be consistent about what
is on each physical line.

\section* {General}

\subsection* {Avoid set!}

The primitive procedures \code{set!} and \code{vector-set!} should
be avoided. If mutation is necessary, consider using processes,
hashtables, or dictionaries to help abstract the details into an easy
to reason about form.

Don't do this:
\antipar
\begin{alltt}
(define (sum ls)
  (let ([acc 0])
    (for-each
     (lambda (x)
       (set! acc (+ acc x)))
     ls)
    acc))
\end{alltt}

A better form without \code{set!} is:
\antipar
\begin{alltt}
(define (sum ls)
  (fold-left
   (lambda (acc x)
     (+ acc x))
   0
   ls))
\end{alltt}

\subsection* {Use structured data instead of strings}

Use structured data to communicate to other parts of the system. Using
strings directly makes localization much harder.

Don't do this:
\antipar
\begin{alltt}
(format "Homing stalled for motor ~a at step ~d" name step)
\end{alltt}

Do this:
\antipar
\begin{alltt}
`\#(home-stalled ,name ,step)
\end{alltt}

Symbols can be used in structured data. Structured data can be pattern
matched and converted to strings in an appropriate language.

\subsection* {Do not program defensively}

A defensive program is one where the programmer does not trust the
input data to the part of the system they are programming. In general
one should not test input data to functions for correctness. Most of
the code in the system should be written with the assumption that the
input data to the function in question is correct. Only a small part
of the code should actually perform any checking of the data. This is
usually done when data enters the system for the first time. Once data
has been checked as it enters the system, it should thereafter be
assumed correct.

\subsection* {Think about append}

\code{append} will copy all of its arguments except the last. Its
time and space complexity are O($n$) for a list of $n$ elements.

O($n$) is likely fine in some cases, but repeated calls to
\code{append} will result in O($n^2$) or worse. Here is an example
that could be written better without \code{append}.
\antipar
\begin{alltt}
(let lp ([ls (list 1 2 3)] [seen '()])
  (match ls
    [() seen]
    [(,first . ,rest)
     (lp rest (append seen (list first)))]))
\end{alltt}

This version of the code is O($n$) to traverse the list, uses
\code{cons} to build up a result, then uses \code{reverse} which
is also O($n$) to return the result in the proper order.
\antipar
\begin{alltt}
(let lp ([ls (list 1 2 3)] [seen '()])
  (match ls
    [() (reverse seen)]
    [(,first . ,rest)
     (lp rest (cons first seen))]))
\end{alltt}

This is really a more general rule about knowing what the functions
you are calling do. Understand their performance characteristics and
know that they are the right functions to use.

\subsection* {Use match instead of car and cdr}

Over time, we have found \code{match} to be simple to read. It is
so nice that we began trying to minimize our direct usage of
\code{car} and \code{cdr}.

Without \code{match}:
\antipar
\begin{alltt}
(define (fold f acc ls)
  (if (null? ls)
      acc
      (fold f (f (car ls) acc) (cdr ls))))
\end{alltt}

With \code{match}:
\antipar
\begin{alltt}
(define (fold f acc ls)
  (match ls
    [() acc]
    [(,first . ,rest) (fold f (f first acc) rest)]))
\end{alltt}

\subsection* {Use match or match-let* with records}

When binding multiple fields from a record, use \code{match} or
\code{match-let*} to minimize type checking.

Given:
\antipar
\begin{alltt}
(define-record <point> x y z)
\end{alltt}

Don't extract each field:
\antipar
\begin{alltt}
(lambda (p)
  (let ([x (<point> x p)]
        [y (<point> y p)]
        [z (<point> z p)])
    (list x y z)))
\end{alltt}

Extract all fields at once:
\antipar
\begin{alltt}
(lambda (p)
  (match-let* ([`(<point> [x ,x] [y ,y] [z ,z]) p])
    (list x y z)))
\end{alltt}

\subsection* {Fail fast}

When dealing with code that uses exceptions, use a fail-fast approach
for the code. This usually produces code that is easier to read and
reason about.

Don't do this:
\antipar
\begin{alltt}
(if \var{condition}
    (success)
    (exit 'boom!))
\end{alltt}

Do this:
\antipar
\begin{alltt}
(unless \var{condition}
  (exit 'boom!))
(success)
\end{alltt}

\subsection* {Know when to use \texttt{eq?}, \texttt{eqv?},
  \texttt{equal?}, and \texttt{=}}

Chapter 6 of \emph{The Scheme Programming
  Language}~\cite{the-scheme-programming-language} discusses
equivalence.

Use \code{eq?} to check if two objects are represented by the same
pointer value.

Use \code{eqv?} to check if two objects are equivalent. This works
with simple data like numbers, booleans, and characters.

Use \code{equal?} to check if two objects have the same
structure. This works with compound data like strings, lists, and
vectors.

Use \code{=} to check if two numbers are equal.

\subsection* {Tag messages}

Messages should be tagged. This makes the order of \code{receive}
and \code{match} statements less important and the implementation of
new messages easier.

Don't do this:
\antipar
\begin{alltt}
(define (loop)
  (receive
   [(,msg ,args)
    (apply printf msg args)
    (loop)]))
\end{alltt}

Do this:
\antipar
\begin{alltt}
(define (loop)
  (receive
   [\#(print ,msg ,args)
    (apply printf msg args)
    (loop)]))
\end{alltt}

\subsection* {Libraries}

The filename and library name should be consistent. The export and
import lists should be sorted. The \code{except} clauses should be
at the end of the \code{import} list.

In Emacs, select multiple lines and use Meta-X \code{sort-lines}.

For example in \texttt{swish/gen-server.ss} we find the
\code{(swish gen-server)} library: \antipar
\begin{alltt}
(library (swish gen-server)
  (export
   define-state-record
   gen-server:call
   gen-server:cast
   gen-server:debug
   gen-server:reply
   gen-server:start
   gen-server:start&link
   )
  (import
   (swish erlang)
   (swish event-mgr-notify)
   (swish events)
   (except (chezscheme) define-record exit)
   )
\end{alltt}

\section* {Concurrency}

\subsection* {Input and Output}

When choosing which input/output functions to use, prefer the ones
provided by the concurrency subsystem. Chez Scheme's builtin
operations may prevent the entire system from functioning for a period
of time. Our versions of the functions will initiate asynchronous read
and write operations, then continue processing other activities.

\subsection* {Event-loop Callbacks}

Inspect event-loop callbacks with great scrutiny. Well-designed
callbacks typically register objects that wrap operating system
interface handles with a guardian and send messages to a
process. These types of operations neither block nor fail.

\subsection* {Finalizers}

Ill-behaved finalizers may cause memory and handle leaks. Inspect
finalizers with great scrutiny. Well-designed finalizers guard against
errors when closing handles and include time-outs so that they don't
wait indefinitely.

\subsection* {\texttt{gen-server}}

In \code{handle-call}, \code{handle-cast}, and
\code{handle-info}, do not use specific match clauses to guard
against unexpected messages. An unexpected message will cause the
server to crash, and the framework will report the failure.

\section* {Style}

Chapter~1 of \emph{The Scheme Programming Language} provides a good
starting point for writing Scheme code.

\subsection* {Only bind variables you use}

\subsection* {Identifiers}

Use meaningful names---this can be very difficult. Identifiers should
correspond directly to the names used in the design
documents. Identifiers should use lower-case letters with a hyphen
separating compound words. Mixed-case identifiers may be used when
they directly correspond to an external definition.

\subsection* {Comments}

Comments should be clear, concise, and written in U.S. English.

Avoid using comments that say what the code says.

\subsection* {Formatting}

Scheme code should be indented according to the Emacs Scheme mode
(\texttt{scheme.el}). Ctrl-Meta-Q in Emacs will reindent an
expression.

Line length should be limited to 79 characters. Lines longer than 79
characters may be tolerated.

Lines should end in LF, not CRLF.

Tab characters should not appear in Scheme code. Their presence in a
file makes the indentation depend on the software used to view the
file.
